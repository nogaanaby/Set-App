to add the game

animations- library or my one css animations file

MOBILE!!! - make sure the game and start page is ok and arrange the practice and instractions page
game : end of game + clock

design - there are staff I can improv, dorn will be the guy dont spend time on it

dont repit yourself on code:

almost every page has the coontext and computed\mounted methods, witch turning complicated every time,
make sure theres a different component for the canvasses and the drowings
